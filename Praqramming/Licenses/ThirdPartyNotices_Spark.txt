	  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
	  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

	   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
	   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license 
	   to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly 
	   perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works

		non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated

		applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor 
		that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
		combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 
		Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
		against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
		lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within 
		the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then 
		any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work 
		shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

	4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
	   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, 
	   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following 
	   conditions: 

		(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative 
		    Works a copy of this License; and 

		(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
		     stating that You changed the files; and 

		(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that 
		    You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
		    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding 
		    those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
		    Works; and 

		(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
		    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
		    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
		    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
		    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of 
		    the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as 
		    part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
		    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
		    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
		    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
		    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
		    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices 
		    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an 
		    addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such 
		    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying 
		    the License. 

	   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
	   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for 
	   use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any 
	   such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, 
	   and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions 
	   stated in this License. 

	5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

	   this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
	   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
	   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
	   with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 

	6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
	   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
	   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
	   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 

	7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to 
	   in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor 
	   provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
	   OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, 
	   without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, 
	   NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
	   PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
	   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
	   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this 
	   License. 

	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
	   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
	   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
	   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
	   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
	   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
	   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
	   (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
	   stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 
	   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been 
	   advised of the possibility of such damages. 

	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the 
	   Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
	   charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or 
	   other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
	   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
	   Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any 
	   other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and 
	   hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
	   claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting 
	   any such warranty or additional liability.
